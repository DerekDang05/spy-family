  ## Description
  This challenge required me to create an application that creates an svg logo based on the users selections. The requirements are the following:

  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
  WHEN I am prompted for text
  THEN I can enter up to three characters
  WHEN I am prompted for the text color
  THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
  WHEN I am prompted for a shape
  THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
  WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
  THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
  WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
  THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
  AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
  WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
  THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
